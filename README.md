# Chess-Multiplayer-Prototype
The goal of this project is to create a Unity Multiplayer chess program.

This is a from scratch chess program that will support hotseat and eventually
networked multiplayer using an implementation of Photon Unity Networking.

All sprites were made by me in Sketchbook Pro and Photoshop.
